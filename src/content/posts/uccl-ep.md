GPU-driven communication (e.g., DeepEP) is the key to efficient and large-scale EP, but it cannot run on heterogeneous platforms in the public cloud due to tight coupling between GPU and NIC. UCCL-EP has exactly the same interface and functionality as DeepEP, but allows you to run GPU-driven communication for MoE models on public clouds, such as AWS, with superior performance to the state-of-the-art. Our ultimate goal with UCCL-EP is to democratize EP for heterogeneous GPUs and NIC vendors, including AMD GPUs, Broadcom NICs, AMD Pensando NICs, and more.
